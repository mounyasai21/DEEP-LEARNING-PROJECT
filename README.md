# PROJECT INFORMATION: Age and Gender Prediction Using Deep Learning
# Task Overview
This project focuses on building a deep learning model capable of predicting a person's age and gender based on facial images. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model will extract meaningful patterns from images and classify them accurately. The dataset used for training consists of facial images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity, allowing the model to learn distinguishing features for reliable predictions.

# Project Objectives
The main objective of this task is to develop an AI-powered facial recognition model that can efficiently determine age and gender. To achieve this, the following key steps will be performed:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, resizing, and normalizing the dataset to ensure consistency.
Feature Extraction: Using CNNs to identify important facial characteristics related to age and gender.
Model Training: Building and training a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy and performance using metrics such as loss and accuracy.
Optimization: Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve model efficiency and accuracy.
#  Importance of Age and Gender Prediction
Accurate age and gender prediction has numerous practical applications across industries:
✔ Personalized Marketing – Businesses can target customers more effectively with tailored advertisements.
✔ Security & Authentication – Used for access control and age verification in restricted areas.
✔ Healthcare – Helps in medical diagnostics, patient monitoring, and personalized treatments.
✔ Human-Computer Interaction – AI-powered assistants can adapt their responses based on user demographics.

# Dataset Used
For this project, the UTKFace Dataset is used, which contains a large collection of facial images with age, gender, and ethnicity labels. This diverse dataset ensures that the model learns to generalize across different demographics.
